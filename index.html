									<h2>Legend of Zelda Remake</h2>

									<h2>Clone Friends</h2>
									<p>Made as the second project for EECS 494: Intro to Game Development. The development lasted two weeks, which is slightly short for a game designer. The game is designed to be a platform game, where player has to solve puzzles and break thorugh barriers. There are mutiple levels for player to dig deep into the game.</p>

									<h2>Slime Handed</h2>
									<p>Made as the final class project for EECS 494: Intro to Game Development. The development occurred over a month and a half with playtesting occuring each week. I picked a good house to pick my way into. Not a soul inside tonight... I heard the owner keeps a gem around here somewhere. CREEEEEEEAK! Gotcha. Not even one alarm trigg- Caught by a mage in an attempt to steal a transmuting gem, our "heroic" thief becomes nothing but goo. Ironically the gem is the only chance at transforming back to human form. As such he must continue the theft... as a slime. Sling the thief like a golf ball across 5 shelfs filled with perilous magics left behind to torture slime people who dared to cross the mage. Careful. The mage leaves the gem just within your grasp only to watch you squirm.</p>
