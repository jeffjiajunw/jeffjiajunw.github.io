								<h2>Fake Stack Overflow</h2>
                				<p>This project is a **full-stack web application** inspired by Stack Overflow, designed to allow users to post, answer, and interact with programming-related questions. Built using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MangoDB, this platform features a responsive UI, user authentication, and dynamic content updates. Users can upvote or downvote answers, search for relevant questions, and track their contributions.</p>

									<h2>Slime Handed</h2>
									<p>Made as the final class project for EECS 494: Intro to Game Development. The development occurred over a month and a half with playtesting occuring each week. I picked a good house to pick my way into. Not a soul inside tonight... I heard the owner keeps a gem around here somewhere. CREEEEEEEAK! Gotcha. Not even one alarm trigg- Caught by a mage in an attempt to steal a transmuting gem, our "heroic" thief becomes nothing but goo. Ironically the gem is the only chance at transforming back to human form. As such he must continue the theft... as a slime. Sling the thief like a golf ball across 5 shelfs filled with perilous magics left behind to torture slime people who dared to cross the mage. Careful. The mage leaves the gem just within your grasp only to watch you squirm.</p>

                  <p>A chrome extension developed by a group in Human-AI lab, Unversity of Michigan. This extension enable user to do a all-in-one search. We used the knowledge of JavaScript and HTML to design and polished the webpage. We used Python to design the searching algotithm in order to perform searching based on similarity. </p>

                  <h2>Steganography and Modern Communication</h2>
                  <p>By combining the intricate arts of steganography and cryptography within an Android application called Cryptex. Cryptex is a product aiming to provide an all-in-one communication platform integrated with steganography, which is secure, fun, and fast. Cryptex is designed to be two parts, which are the sender and receiver separately. Sender allows users to retrieve keys from the receiver, input text, choose encryption media and send encrypted while the receiver can receive text and decrypt text. Also, we add a public key that is only known between the sender and the receiver to ensure safety. </p>
